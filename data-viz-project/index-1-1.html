    <h1>Do the NFL teams with the best defenses have the most wins?</h1>
    <h3>By Ben Reitman</h3>
    <p>One of the oldest sayings in sports is that "Defense wins championships." So, does that saying hold true for the NFL, at least for last season? </p>

<p>As shown in the results, the best teams in terms of winning percentage were not all on the Top 10 Defenses chart. Several teams landed on both charts. Two teams from the NFC landed on both charts: the Philadelphia Eagles and the San Francisco 49ers. Not surprisingly, these were the two best teams in the NFC, and they ended up facing each other in the NFC Championship game. Additionally, two teams from the AFC were on both charts: the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens. Interestingly enough, neither of these teams reached the AFC Championship. The Kansas City Chiefs, who won last seaosn's Super Bowl, did not have a top ten defense.</p>
